# Senior-Project

This my senior project I presented 5/14/22 on display day at ECHS.

I stayed up the night before until 3am finishing it up so that it can be used by other people.
I also had trouble with networking and other devices connecting to it on different networks

But all said and done, this is my project and I'm so proud of what I've learned and created, and hope I inspired at least one person to continue their passions into technology

This is my project, a Local Network Storage System, a clone of Google Drive I call, Goggle Drove.
